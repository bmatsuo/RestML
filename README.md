##RestML: Stabilize your API

RestML is an XML vocabulary for specifying RESTful HTTP services.
The goal of RestML is support authenticated of JSON and XML APIs.

##Features

- Specification of GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE actions.
- Specification of path, query, and form parameters
- An API playground with a variable Accept header type request/response
inspection.
- A __completely__ customizable UI.

##Key differences from Swagger

- XML based with an xml schema for proper validation and tooling.
- AngularJS based UI. Completely customizable out of the box (style and
content).
- A higher level of abstraction and a concentration on distributed
specification lets RestML serve your entire company's API documentation
in a way that's modular and manageable with a consistent interface.

##Plans

- parameter/response model specification
- client-side parameter validation
